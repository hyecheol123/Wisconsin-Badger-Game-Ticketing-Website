## Quick Start Guide

After clone this repository, you have to install dependencies by typing `npm install` (Assume that proper Node.js environment already setup).  

To run the scripts, type `npm run <script name>`.
Available scripts are described below.

## Scripts

Here is the list for npm/yarn scripts.
These are used to lint, test, build, and run teh code.

1. `lint`: lint the code.
2. `lint:fix`: lint the code and try auto-fix.
3. `dev`: Run webpack dev server
4. `build`: Build website based on the `browserslint`. (destination: `dist` Directory)

No tests are implemented.
To enforce code styling, inspect and lint the codes on commit and push.

## Dependencies/Environment

Developed and tested with `Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS aarch64` and `Node v16.17.1`.  

TypeScript React Development environment is set up manually with `ESLint`, `Prettier`, `WebPack`, and `Babel`, rather than using other Boilerplate codes (such as `create-react-app`).
For code styling rules and deploy configurations, please refer to the setup files.  

Used `React 18.2.0` and `React Router 6.4.2`.
Also utilize `Material UI (MUI) Library v5.10.9` for elegant design.

## Database Structure & Schema

**TODO: TBD**
